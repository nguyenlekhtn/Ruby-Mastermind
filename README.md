# Mastermind  
This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum

# Gameplay and rules

There are 6 different colors pegs that form a 4 peg "code" that another player tries to break in 12 guesses. After each guess, they receive feedback on the number of pegs that were the right color or if that right color was also in the correct spot.

# Instructions

This Mastermind game is a 1-player game, played in command line. You can choose to be the code-breaker to guess the secret code made by computer, or the code-maker to create the secret code for the computer to break. I assigned number 1-6 to each of colored pegs, so to enter or guess code, your input has to be in format '1234'.
